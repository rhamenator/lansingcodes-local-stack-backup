# Upcoming Newsletter Events

This website shows upcoming events from the
[Lansing Codes API](https://github.com/lansingcodes/api)
in lists that can be easily copied and pasted into a monthly newsletter.
The page reads the public Firestore `events` collection using its REST API.

## Local development

The site is served directly by GitHub Pages; no build step or deployment
change is needed. Run `npm start` for a local static server. Use Node.js 24
and run `npm ci && npm test` to check the month query, Firestore response
parsing, and safe event link rendering. `vendor/moment.min.js` is the local
Moment 2.31.0 browser build, with its license alongside it.
